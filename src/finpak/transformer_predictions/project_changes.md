## Changes Made to train_v4.py

1. Modified cycler reset behavior:
   - Changed all cycler resets to use `reset_and_randomize()` instead of `reset()`
   - This affects both train and validation cyclers
   - The change ensures subsets are shuffled each time they're reset

2. Removed early stopping logic:
   - Training now continues until n_epochs is reached
   - Both train and validation cyclers will continue cycling until exhausted, then reset and continue
   - Checkpoints are still saved based on validation loss

3. Fixed checkpoint metadata structure:
   - Changed closing brace `}` to closing parenthesis `)` for TrainingMetadata instantiation
   - This aligns with the dataclass definition

## Potential Impact and Considerations

1. Randomization Effects:
   - Using `reset_and_randomize()` means subset order will be different after each reset
   - Consider logging subset orders if exact reproduction is needed

2. Training Duration:
   - Removing early stopping means training will always run for full n_epochs

3. Memory Usage:
   - Continuous cycling without early stopping means more checkpoints might be saved
   - Monitor disk space usage, especially for long training runs
   - Consider implementing checkpoint cleanup strategy if needed

## Recommendations

1. Consider implementing checkpoint cleanup strategy
2. Add logging of subset orders if reproducibility is important
3. Review checkpoint selection criteria in dependent scripts
