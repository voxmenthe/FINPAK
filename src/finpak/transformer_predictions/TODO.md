Fourier Integration
* Use the right `create_stock_features` function from `mf_preprocessing.py` and make sure its correctly integrated everywhere
* Double check the `StockFeatures` class
* Double check that all parameters are correctly passed from the config dict


* Try SOAP optimiser from: https://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP
* Test on a CUDA system

* Basic experimentation with bin sizes and frequencies for fourier features
