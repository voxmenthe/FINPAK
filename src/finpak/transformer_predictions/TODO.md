Learning Rate & Warmup Steps
* Try having acceleration and/or deceleration in the learning rate schedule based on the loss



Fourier Integration
* Use the right `create_stock_features` function from `mf_preprocessing.py` and make sure its correctly integrated everywhere
* Double check the `StockFeatures` class
* Double check that all parameters are correctly passed from the config dict
* Basic experimentation with bin sizes and frequencies for fourier features
* Go back and look at the diff

Optimizers
* Try schedulefree optimisers
* Try Muon
* Try SOAP optimiser from: https://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP



* Test on a CUDA system
