I'll look into the early stopping logic in the training process. Let me examine the file first.

Read file: src/finpak/transformer_predictions/train.py


Based on the code analysis, I'll explain exactly when early stopping is triggered and when we move to the next train subset. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Early stopping is controlled by several conditions and parameters:

1. **Minimum Requirements**:
```python
min_cycles_complete = cycles_completed >= 2
min_epochs_complete = epochs_in_subset >= min_epochs_per_subset
```
Early stopping will only be considered if:
- At least 2 learning rate cycles have completed
- The model has trained for at least `min_epochs_per_subset` epochs on the current subset
  - `min_epochs_per_subset` is set to `cycle_length * 2` by default

2. **Early Stopping Patience**:
```python
base_patience = config['train_params']['patience']
cycle_based_patience = (cycle_length * 2) + base_patience
```
The patience is dynamically calculated based on:
- The base patience from config
- The cycle length (multiplied by 2)

3. **Early Stopping Trigger**:
Early stopping is checked using the `early_stop(current_val_loss)` call, which will return True if:
- The validation loss hasn't improved by at least `min_delta` (from config)
- For `cycle_based_patience` number of checkpoints

4. **Moving to Next Subset**:
When early stopping is triggered, the following process occurs:

a) First, it checks if there are more subsets available:
```python
if train_cycler and train_cycler.has_more_subsets():
```

b) Then it filters checkpoints based on these criteria:
- Only checkpoints after the first learning rate cycle
- Only checkpoints with loss better than the median performance
- Only checkpoints that meet the minimum epochs requirement

c) If valid checkpoints exist:
- Loads the best checkpoint (lowest validation loss)
- Moves to the next subset (`train_cycler.next_subset()`)
- Resets the optimizer and scheduler
- Creates new dataloaders for the next subset
- Resets early stopping for the new subset

5. **Training Termination**:
Training will completely stop if:
- Early stopping is triggered AND there are no more subsets to train on
- OR if all subsets have been processed

Here's a concrete example:

Let's say we have these parameters:
- `cycle_length = 10` epochs
- `base_patience = 5`
- `min_epochs_per_subset = 20`
- `min_delta = 0.0001`

Then:
1. Early stopping won't be considered until:
   - At least 20 epochs have passed on the current subset
   - At least 2 full learning rate cycles (20 epochs) have completed

2. The effective patience will be:
   - `cycle_based_patience = (10 * 2) + 5 = 25`

3. Early stopping will trigger if:
   - The validation loss hasn't improved by 0.0001 for 25 checkpoints
   - AND we've met the minimum epochs/cycles requirements

4. When triggered:
   - If there are more subsets: loads best checkpoint and moves to next subset
   - If no more subsets: ends training completely

This design ensures that:
1. Each subset gets adequate training time (at least 2 full cycles)
2. The model has enough patience to find good solutions
3. We don't waste time on plateaued training
4. We maintain the best performing model state when moving between subsets

Let me analyze the checkpoint rewinding logic specifically. Here's the relevant code and conditions:

When early stopping is triggered and there are more subsets to train on, there's a specific filtering process for determining valid checkpoint candidates:

```python
# Filter checkpoints to only those after first learning rate cycle
valid_checkpoints = []
for loss, ep, name, epochs in current_subset_checkpoints:
    # Only consider checkpoints that were among the best (i.e., actually saved)
    checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, name)
    if (epochs >= min_epochs_per_subset and 
        os.path.exists(checkpoint_path) and 
        loss <= statistics.median([x[0] for x in current_subset_checkpoints])):  # Only consider better than median performance
        try:
            checkpoint_epoch, cycles = get_checkpoint_cycle_info(
                checkpoint_path,
                config['train_params']['scheduler'],
                len(train_loader)
            )
            if cycles >= 1:  # Only consider checkpoints after first cycle
                valid_checkpoints.append((loss, checkpoint_epoch, name))
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: Error reading checkpoint {name}: {e}")
            continue
```

Here are the specific restrictions for a checkpoint to be considered valid for rewinding:

1. **Minimum Training Duration**:
   - Must have trained for at least `min_epochs_per_subset` epochs
   ```python
   epochs >= min_epochs_per_subset
   ```

2. **Checkpoint Must Exist**:
   - The checkpoint file must physically exist in the checkpoint directory
   ```python
   os.path.exists(checkpoint_path)
   ```

3. **Performance Threshold**:
   - The validation loss must be better than or equal to the median loss of all checkpoints for this subset
   ```python
   loss <= statistics.median([x[0] for x in current_subset_checkpoints])
   ```

4. **Learning Rate Cycle Requirement**:
   - Must be from after the first learning rate cycle is completed
   ```python
   cycles >= 1
   ```

Once these valid candidates are identified, the selection process is straightforward:

```python
if valid_checkpoints:
    # Load best checkpoint after first cycle
    best_loss, best_epoch, best_name = min(valid_checkpoints, key=lambda x: x[0])
```

The checkpoint with the lowest validation loss among the valid candidates is selected.

Important Implementation Details:

1. **Cycle Information Retrieval**:
```python
checkpoint_epoch, cycles = get_checkpoint_cycle_info(
    checkpoint_path,
    config['train_params']['scheduler'],
    len(train_loader)
)
```
This extracts the number of completed learning rate cycles from the checkpoint metadata.

2. **State Restoration**:
When loading the selected checkpoint:
```python
checkpoint = torch.load(os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, best_name))
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
model = model.to(device)
```

3. **Optimizer and Scheduler Reset**:
```python
optimizer = OPTIMIZER(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=config['train_params']['scheduler']['base_lr'],
    betas=(0.9, 0.95),
    weight_decay=weight_decay
)
scheduler = get_scheduler(optimizer, config, len(train_loader))
```
The optimizer and scheduler are reset with fresh states rather than loaded from the checkpoint.

If no valid checkpoints are found (i.e., none meet all the criteria above), the training will proceed to the next subset without rewinding to a previous checkpoint.

This logic ensures that:
1. We only rewind to checkpoints that have had sufficient training time
2. We don't rewind to poorly performing checkpoints (below median performance)
3. We only consider checkpoints after the learning rate schedule has completed at least one full cycle
4. We always choose the best performing checkpoint among the valid candidates
